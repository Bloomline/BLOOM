"Daring Pilot

At age 23, Barrington Irving became the youngest person to fly alone around the world—in a small plane he built himself. Since then, he started a company called Experience Aviation. It helps students learn about flying and other subjects, like science and math. Students can study in the “Flying Classroom” or learn how to build cars.

Here, Barrington Irving talks about his love of flying and his flight around the world.

Why do you fly?
I love being in the air between the sky and the Earth. It’s exciting, but I also feel very calm.

Are you ever afraid?
Yes, I was very afraid one time. It was during my flight around the world. I had to fly from Japan to a small
island called Shemya, near Alaska. The flight was challenging. It was very windy, and then there was a bad storm. At one point, the radio pilots on the ground sent me a message. They said, “You have to go back to Japan.” And I said, “I don’t have enough fuel to go back.” It was risky to continue, but I took a chance and kept going. The radio pilots asked for my parents’ phone number. It was the end for me, they thought, but I didn’t give up. When I got to Shemya Island, I had 12 minutes of fuel left.

What a frightening experience!
Yes, it was, but I got to Shemya safely. I made it. And I learned a lot about flying.""
